# (PART\*) Shiny in action {-}

# Introduction {-}

Now that you have the basics of Shiny apps under your belt, the following six chapters give you a grab bag on important techniques.

I don't recommend reading these chapters deeply in sequence. Instead, skim them so you get a good sense of what they cover, and then dip your toes back in as you need the techniques in your app.  

To get the most of the next sections of this book, you're going to have to produce a bunch of Shiny apps so you integrate the basic ideas of Shiny into your brain.
